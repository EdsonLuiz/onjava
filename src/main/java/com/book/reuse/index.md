# Reuse  

1. You can create objects of your existing classes inside new the class. This is called **composition**, because the new class is **composed** of objects of existing classes.
2. You can create a new class as a **type** of an existing class. You literally take the form of the existing class and add code to it without modifying the existing class. This technic is called **inheritance**, and the compiler does most of the work.

## composition  

Simple place object references inside new classes.
